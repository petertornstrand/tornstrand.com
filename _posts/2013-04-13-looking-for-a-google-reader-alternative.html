title: Looking for a Google Reader alternative

<p class="lead">Like most people using <a href="https://www.google.se/reader">Google Reader</a> I was shocked to hear they were closing shop. This is a first for me, I have never gone through a painful service breakup.</p>

<p>Usaually it's I who choose to leave a service because I've found something new and exciting. But this time it was I who was dumped. Well, no point in lingering. I set out to find a new place to get my RSS aggregation needs fullfilled.</p>

<p>To my surprise finding an alternative to Google Reader was not such a walk in the park as I imagined. Turns out Google actually did a heck of a job with Reader. I never really thought much about it. It just did what I expected it to do and I didn't really need that many features. It was convenient, and future proof I thought, that it was a Google service.</p>

<blockquote>...I wasn't going to waste time getting used to it. That is because of the company's now-established track record of killing off products that prove to have niche rather than sufficiently mass appeal.<br>&mdash; James Fallows</blockquote>

<p>I must say that this whole business has in a way chipped my trust in Google. I think James Fallows of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> said it best in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/finale-for-now-on-googles-self-inflicted-trust-problem/274286/">his post on the topic</a>. Like him I find myself leaning towards none Google alternatives when possible.</p>

<p>There are lots of good articles and blog posts out there covering this topic. Below are a few I found usefull in my search for a Reader replacement.</p>

<p>I initially went with <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>. I was lured in by its sleek looks and availability for both Android and iPhone platform. I used it for about three weeks before I got tired of the user interface. It's just too much and does not feel like Reader at all.</p>

<p>I'm now using <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a> and it looks promising. The user interface looks just like Reader and it has a great import tool that got me up and running in just a few seconds.</p>
