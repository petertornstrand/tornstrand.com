<p>I just signed up for a individual sponsor package for <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon London</a>. It's just 65 pounds and I feel it's the least I can do for the community for all the help I have received over the years.</p>

<p>My company, <a href="http://www.happiness.se/">Happiness</a>, will probably make a bigger commitment but if you have the money, go for it!</p>
