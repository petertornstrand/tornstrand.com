title: Switched from Wordpress to Drupal
disqus_id: node/70

<p>Today I migrated this site from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Nowadays I mostly do programming related to Drupal so it seemed like the right thing to do. The content migration went smooth using the Drupal modules <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feeds_xpathparser">Feeds XPath Parser</a>. Using these modules I was able to create nodes from the standard <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/what-is-an-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-file">WordPress eXtended Rss</a> export file.</p>

<p>There is still some tinkering left to do like find a more exciting theme and perhaps setup some kind of archive. Well, we'll see what happens.</p>
