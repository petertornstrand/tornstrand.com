title: Drupal Flickr Photoset block module
disqus_id: node/66

<p>I have previously written about creating photo galleries using the Flickr Field module. Before I came up with the solution described in the post Drupal Flickr gallery using Flickr field I developed a Flickr Photoset block module. Since I'm not going to use it nor contribute it to the Drupal contrib repository I thought I at least upload it here put it on GitHub so that anyone that might be in need of a Photoset block can use it.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/petertornstrand/Flickr-Photoset-Block">The module</a> is still in early development but fully functional. Use it at your own risk.</p>
